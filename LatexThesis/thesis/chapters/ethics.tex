\chapter{An Ethical Analysis}
\label{section:ethics}

Ethical considerations play a crucial role in engineering projects, particularly in the realm of healthcare and medical technology. Engineering endeavors, especially those aimed at improving healthcare outcomes, inherently involve decisions that impact individuals' well-being, safety, and autonomy. Therefore, in this paper, I seek to explore these ethical dimensions within the context of OIT application development, explaining how I designed a solution that not only enhances patient experience and treatment outcomes but also aligns with ethical principles governing healthcare innovation.

The following sections will outline the ethical justification for my project, identify significant ethical issues, provide reasons for decisions and actions, draw on ethical resources, and conclude with reflections on the ethical implications of the project for the broader healthcare landscape. Throughout this paper, I will draw upon established ethical frameworks, engineering codes of ethics, and additional ethical concepts to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the ethical considerations surrounding the development and implementation of the OIT application.
