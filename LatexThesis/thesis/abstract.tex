Millions of individuals in the United States confront the daily challenges of food allergies, with the threat of potentially life-threatening reactions ever-present. Oral Immunotherapy (OIT) emerges as a beacon of hope in this landscape, gradually desensitizing patients to their allergens. This groundbreaking treatment, contrasting avoidance strategies, promises a life with fewer restrictions. However, it is a journey fraught with complexities, requiring rigorous adherence to protocols, emotional fortitude, and frequent medical supervision for patients. This thesis centers on the creation of an iPhone application tailored to OIT patients, leveraging Apple's privacy and security features. The app integrates seamlessly with the Apple Health app, providing a platform for dose tracking, symptom logging, and the visualization of long-term trends. As a comprehensive resource, it educates users about anaphylaxis and OIT. This project seeks to address the unmet needs of OIT patients, offering vital support, guidance, and resources, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for those grappling with food allergies.
